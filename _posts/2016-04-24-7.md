## 1. System Architecture

The Raspberry Pi is an ARM-based device and therefore needs binaries compiled for this architecture. These binaries are provided by the Arch Linux ARM project which ports Arch Linux to ARM-based devices. They also have a separate community and forum on their website, while original forum does not support ARM specific issues. With the introduction of the Raspberry Pi 2 the packages needed now depend on which architecture the devices has:

* ARMv6 (BCM2835): Raspberry Pi Model A, A+, B, B+, Zero
* ARMv7 (BCM2836): Raspberry Pi 2 (based on Model B+)
* ARMv8 (BCM2837): Raspberry Pi 3

I use Arch Linux ARMv6 Image for Raspberry Pi Model B+ by Linux Mint as main PC

## 2. SD card partition task

* This task will be done with root account, not sudo.

First of all, login with root by

```bash
$ su
```

Input password, insert your SD card, check out device name of SD card and partitions.

```
# fdisk -l
```

<strong><span style="color: red;"># Important #</span></strong> 

You can find what your Linux loads device name of SD card

In my case as see below,

* Device Name: <strong><span style="color: red;">/dev/mmcblk0</span></strong>
* Partition Name: <strong><span style="color: red;">/dev/mmcblk0p1</span></strong>

mmcblk0 is device name, mmcblk0p1 and mmcblk0p2 are paritions name.

Delete all existing parition tables and create new.

Run fdisk with your SD card device name.

```bash
# fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
```

Command followings in order.

* Delete all existing partition

```bash
o
```
* List partition

```bash
p
```

* Create new partition (Primary, #1, Size for 100MB, W95 FAT32)

```bash
n
p
1
Enter
+100M
t
c
```

* Create new partition (Primary, #2, Size for all remain)

```bash
n
p
2
Enter
Enter
```

Excute above commands and exit fdisk

```bash
w
```

Screen capture for all above process:

Once you created new partitions, make patitions for usable file system.

Sometimes paritions are mounted automatically, so unmount partitions.

```bash
umount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /dev/mmcblk0p2
```

Make partition #1 as vfat, create boot folder, mount partition into boot folder.

```bash
mkfs.vfat /dev/mmcblk0p1
```

```bash
mkdir boot
```

```bash
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 boot
```

Make partition #2 as ext4, create root folder, mount partition into root folder.

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2
```

```bash
mkdir root
```

```bash
mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 root
```

## 3. Download image file and install on SD card

Download suitable image file for your Raspberry Pi version, copy to root folder of SD card, move boot file system to partition #1, unmount partition.

Below commands for each Raspberry Pi versions. Choose your own.

Install bsdtar if you don't have yet.

```bash
apt install bsdtar -y
```

* Raspberry Pi 1

```bash
wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz
```

```bash
bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz -C root
```

```bash
sync
```

```bash
mv root/boot/* boot
```

```bash
umount boot root
```

* Raspberry Pi 2

```bash
wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz
```

```bash
bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz -C root
```

```bash
sync
```

```bash
mv root/boot/* boot
```

```bash
umount boot root
```

* Raspberry Pi 3

As public website, there isn't specific image for Raspberry Pi 3 yet.

You can use image for Raspberry Pi 2.

Otherwise it's possible to use ARMv8 AArch64 Multi-platform, or ARMv8 Amlogic S905 ODROID-C2 but be cafeful for using unless it is tested properly.

## 4. Boot up Raspberry Pi

Remove SD card from your PC, insert into Raspberry Pi.

Power On.

If you follow above steps correctly, Arch Linux ARM will boot up.

By defualt, you cann access Arch Linux ARM via SSH.

> Hostname : alarmpi
>
> Default user account : alarm / alarm
>
> Default root account : root / root

#### Good luck with your Arch Linux ARM !
