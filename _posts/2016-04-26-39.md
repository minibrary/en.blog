For GUI environment, you can use nice graphical tool such as `Gparted`.

But here I will use bash command to convert my EXT HDD's NTFS partition to EXT4 partition.

<strong><font color="red">### BE CAREFUL! Delete partition or any wrong COMMAND may erase all of your data! Back up your data at safe location before manage your partition. ###</font></strong>

## 1. Check device name

```
$ sudo fdisk -l
```

This command will let you know which devices are recognized on system.

For me, 

- Device is: **`/dev/sdc`**
- Partition is: **`/dev/sdc1`**

## 2. Manage partition

If you found your device to manage, command with <b><font color="red">DEVICE,</font>

```
$sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
```

You can command <b><font color="red">m</font> to check all available commands.

You can command <b><font color="red">p</font> for list of partitions.

First, I delete partition with <b><font color="red">d</font>.

Second, create partition with <b><font color="red">n</font>.

I choosed primary partition with nember 1, and default First sector, Last sector.

Just enter/return will choose default values.

Once you finished to manage partition, command <b><font color="red">w</font> to write.

Now you made your own partition.

But this is not the end. You will need to format partition with your favorite file system to use.
