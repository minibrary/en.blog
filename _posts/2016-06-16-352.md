I wanted to use `docker` if I have time, but it was quite difficult to uderstand `image` and `container`.

And finally I've successed to build pure Arch Linux image by myself.

So, what is `docker`?

I am not a very professional of it, but you can find tons of documents introducing about `docker` on the web.

As my understanding this is half-virtualization for Linux. (Using only User-area independent from original Linux-Kernal, but using your `local Linux-Kernal`.)

There is no official `Arch Linux` docker image, so I decided to build by myself, and yes, it gave me more understanding of `docker`. 

[Minibrary Docker Hub Arch Linux Image Link](https://hub.docker.com/r/minibrary/archlinux/){:target="_blank"}

* My local environment is `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x64`

## 0. Install docker

You can install `docker` by `apt`, `yum` or any other package managers, but I would like to install via `ppa` provided by `docker`.

First of all, check `curl` is installed or not.

```
which curl
```

If no `curl`, install first.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
```

Once you installed `curl`, install `docker` with below command,

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

Shell will ask you `sudo` password once you run command. Input it.

## 1. Pull image

Pull image with below command. (This `Arch Linux` image has built by me.)

```
sudo docker pull minibrary/archlinux
```

List the `docker images` you have.

```
sudo docker images
```

## 2. Run Image

Let's run pulled image with `bash`.

```
sudo docker run -i -t --name arch minibrary/archlinux /bin/bash
```

* `-i` is `interactive` which allows to run even without `connect(attach)`.
* `-t` is `allocate pseudo-TTY` which creates `terminal`.
* `--name arch` creates container with your favorite name (`arch` at here).

Once you run above command, `/bin/bash` will be run.

## 3. Repository update

Currently there is almost nothing in `Arch Linux`, because I built on pure `Arch Linux` without installing any packages.

First of all, let's update `Repository`.

```
pacman -Syu
```

## 4. Exit, and Start

You can `exit` current status of container.

Run `exit` then you will be out of container, and container will be stopped.

```
exit
```

Check the status of container with below command.

```
sudo docker ps
```

Yes, there is nothing.

This command shows `only` running-containers.

Let's check all containers including stopped.

```
sudo docker ps -a
```

There is container named `arch`, `status`is `exited`.

So, how to start container again?

Go with below command, using `name` you created.

It will run with same environment when you created container, command with `sudo docker run ~~~`

```
sudo docker start arch && sudo docker ps
```

At this state, you can `attach` container.

(This brings you `/bin/bash` into container.)

```
sudo docker attach arch
```

Just press any key after run command.

You will see that connected to `Arch Linux` `bash cli`.

If you don't need container any more, you can simply delete so keeping `local Linux` clean!

Yeah, we learned very simple usage of `docker` and `Arch Linux` on `Ubuntu Environmen`!
